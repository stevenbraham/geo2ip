# url2ip
CLI tool to get the ip adres of a url

Often I need to know which server belongs to a domain. I do this by copying the url from my browser to the terminal, remove the https:// and start a ping session.

To simplify this process for me, I developed this tool. 

**Only tested on unix based systems, because I parse the output of the ping program**

# Usage

`url2ip url`, example `url2ip https://www.google.nl`
